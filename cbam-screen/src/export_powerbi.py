"""Star-schema export for Power BI.

Power BI Desktop is a GUI. Nothing about it can be reviewed in a pull request.
So the repo owns everything that can be text: the numbers, the schema, the
measures and the page blueprints. This module is the first of those. It runs the
existing engine over a borrower list and writes a small star schema of csv files
that a Power BI semantic model imports.

Nothing here computes a CBAM number. Every cost, band, flag and cash flow comes
from tiering.py, cost.py, flags.py and liquidity.py, which read config/*.yaml.
This module only decides what shape the answers are written in. If a formula
needs changing, it changes in the engine and this file does not move.

Tables written to the output directory:

    dim_borrower.csv    one row per borrower
    dim_scenario.csv    one row per carbon-price scenario
    dim_branch.csv      one row per rule branch, adopted or proposal
    dim_year.csv        one row per year on the axis
    fact_cost.csv       borrower x year x scenario x branch
    fact_cost_line.csv  the same, broken down to one row per good group, so the
                        formula can be shown with the borrower's own numbers
    fact_liquidity.csv  borrower x scenario x branch x payment
    fact_flags.csv      borrower x flag, active true or false
    questions.csv       flag x question, from config/questions.yaml
    meta.csv            key and value, including the data label and file hashes

Two honest limits are stamped into the output rather than hidden:

    Tier 4 cost needs an upstream sector uplift that portfolio.py computes, and
    portfolio.py does not exist yet (CLAUDE.md Task 9). Tier 4 rows therefore
    carry a cost of zero and a cost_basis that says so. A zero here means "not
    computed", not "no exposure".

    config/scenarios.yaml is gated, because the NGFS Phase V EU prices are not
    published in any fetchable document. Without --prices the exporter fails
    loudly rather than writing zeros. With --prices it stamps the price file and
    its hash into meta.csv and refuses any data label other than FIXTURE.

Command line:

    python -m src.export_powerbi \
        --borrowers data/powerbi_fixture/borrowers_fixture.csv \
        --config-dir tests/fixtures \
        --prices data/powerbi_fixture/prices_fixture.yaml \
        --out data/powerbi_fixture/export

When the gates clear, drop --prices and --config-dir and the same command runs
on the real config with no change to this file.
